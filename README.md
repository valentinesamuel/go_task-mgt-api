# Task Management System API Development Checklist

## Areas to Explore

- [ ] **Basic API Development**
     - [ ] Setting up RESTful APIs, routing, and handling HTTP requests.
     - [ ] Creating endpoints for managing tasks

- [ ] **Data Modeling and Persistence**
     - [ ] Database design, SQL/NoSQL, and data persistence.
     - [ ] Designing schemas for tasks, users, and relationships.

- [ ] **Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing**
     - [ ] Managing concurrent processes for inventory updates.
     - [ ] Using background jobs for low-stock alerts and automated reordering.

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization**
     - [ ] Securing the API with user authentication (e.g., JWT).
     - [ ] Implementing role-based access control.

- [ ] **Error Handling and Validation**
     - [ ] Handling errors and validating inputs for data integrity.

- [ ] **Caching for Performance Optimization**
     - [ ] Reducing database load by caching frequently accessed data.

- [ ] **Testing and TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
     - [ ] Writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the API.

- [ ] **Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting**
     - [ ] Managing large data sets with efficient data retrieval.

- [ ] **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
     - [ ] Controlling access to prevent abuse and ensure resource availability.

- [ ] **Dependency Injection and Interfaces**
     - [ ] Using interfaces and dependency injection for flexibility and testability.

- [ ] **Microservice-Friendly Design**
     - [ ] Structuring the application for potential future microservices.

- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**
     - [ ] Implementing structured logging and tracking key metrics.

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
     - [ ] Handling configurations for multiple environments.

- [ ] **Scalability and Load Balancing**
     - [ ] Designing your application to handle increased traffic.

- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture**
     - [ ] Using an event-based system to handle changes in inventory.

- [ ] **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
     - [ ] Separating read and write operations to improve performance.

- [ ] **Event Sourcing**
     - [ ] Storing changes to data as a series of events.

- [ ] **Distributed Caching**
     - [ ] Implementing a distributed cache to reduce load on your main database.

- [ ] **Database Sharding and Replication**
     - [ ] Splitting and replicating data across multiple databases for high availability and performance.
